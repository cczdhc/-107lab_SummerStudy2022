    <div style="text-align:center ;color:black;">Henan Key Laboratory of Big Data Analysis and Processing</div>
    <p style="color:black;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henan Key Laboratory of Big Data Analysis and Processing won the approval 
        from the Science and Technology
        Department of Henan Province and was established in 2017 at the support of Henan University. It was formerly known as Henan 
        University Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and System. In 2001, 2004 and 2007, it consistently ranked as a 
        university-level key laboratory. In 2009, it was rated as the Open Laboratory of Key-Disciplines in Henan Province. In 2012, it
        was approved to be the Key Laboratory Base of Universities in Henan Province. The laboratory is located in Jinming campus of 
        Henan University. At present, it covers an area of 1500 square metres, possessing large instruments such as high-performance 
        computing platform, cloud computing platform, deep learning computing platform and integrated remote sensing data analysis and
        processing system. The total value of the instruments and equipment over 800 pieces is nearly 16 million yuan.</p>
        <p style="color:black;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 38 researchers in the laboratory, 35 with senior titles and 
        36 doctoral qualifications. Two researchers have got picked for the New Century Talents Project Level-‖. One has won the 
        Henan Province Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars. Three people are supported by the Innovation Talent Fund in 
        Henan Province. 8 are Henan Young Core Instructor. There are more than 80 postgraduates participating in collaborative 
        researches. It is a scientific research team with reasonable structure, pioneering spirit and continuous progress.</p>
        <p style="color:black;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the guidance of the national strategic demand and the policy of 
        serving the local economy and to meet the needs of the social and economic development in our province, based on the 
        government sponsored researches and scientific research projects consigned by enterprises in recent years, the laboratory 
        is supported by the fundamental theory of big data and generic technology. It puts emphasis on the application of big data 
        and exploits the demand of the industry. The three main research directions are big data theory and technology, remote 
        sensing data analysis and processing, big data analysis and processing of vehicle network.</p>
        <p style="color:black;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n the past five years, the laboratory has carried out scientific and 
        technology researches on the three directions and achieved considerable success. More than 300 academic papers have been 
        published, including 200 in SCI and EI. More than 90 projects have been undertaken, including 4 China High-Resolution Earth
        Observation System(CHEOS) projects, 1 project of National Key Technology R&D Program, 1 sub project of National High-tech 
        R&D Program of China (863 Program) and 27 projects supported by NSFC. In addition, the R&D achievements of the laboratory 
        have received 15 awards for all kinds, including 4 of the Henan scientific and technological advanced awards. The team has 
         obtained 26 patents and 13 software copyrights.</p>
        <p style="color:black;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laboratory attaches importance to the cooperation with various 
        research institutes at home and abroad. In China, the lab works with 27 groups or teams including the CNSA Center for 
        Spaceborne Remote Sensing Demonstration, the Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth (RADI) under the CAS, the 
        Institute of Electrics under the CAS, the Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense of Henan 
        Province and China Electronics Technology Group Corporation. They send postgraduates and tutors and participate in CHEOS 
        and major programs of remote sensing data. The successful cooperation with Technology Center of CHEOS, SEC under Ministry 
        of Environmental Protection, Satellite Surveying and Mapping Application Center of NASG and Shenhua Group not only has 
        greatly promoted the popularity of Henan University and Henan Province in the space information application field but also 
        sets up a good image through outstanding contributions. Meanwhile, the lab has established research partnerships with 
        University of Michigan, Wayne State University, University of Miami, University of Waterloo and other well-known 
        universities or scientific research institutions. This long-term and stable cooperation has laid the foundation for a sound
        development of the laboratory.</p>
        <p style="color:black;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the conditions going perfect and favorable, the laboratory will 
        focus on the extension research of big data and carry out the application research. It will also begin study on Internet of 
        things, cloud computing and deep learning and strives to be a national research platform. The laboratory has launched a 
        series of software tools and products in the big data field. The scientific researches and application are the leading 
        level in our country and reach the advanced level in the world.</p>
